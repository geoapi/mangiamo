Please note: We have not included our config.js file in the repository as it contains passwords to our database. You will not be able to download and run our app without it. To obtain a copy of the config file please contact a member of our group. Once you have the config file, it needs to be placed in the app folder.

To run our app, you must have node.js installed. Once installed navigate into the app folder on the command line and run our server with the command "node main.js". Then open a broswer and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/".
